1.  04 May 2017           05 May 2017             vector_difference in            In the if-else statement block, the angle for vertical eye movement            
                                                  EMDAT_core\geometry.py          and that for horizntal eye movement were placed under the wrong condition,   
                                                  lines: 39-42                    swapping the values.

2.  08 May 2017           10 May 2017             second value assignment to      The attribute was actually reassigned the value, len(distances), in that line,
                                                  the numdistances attibute in    overwriting the previously assigned value, len(valid_distance_data), in line
                                                  __init()__ of Segmemt.py        188 in the same __init()__. The former value concerns fixation, while the latter, 
                                                  at line 225                     head distance related to pupil data. The reassigned attribute value was passed to a 
                                                                                  Scene object, where it was used for computation of the mean head distance in line 447 
                                                                                  of Scene.py, affecting the computed mean head distance. A diffent variable was created
                                                                                  for demarcation.                                    

3.  10 May 2017           11 May 2017             calc_rel_angles in Segment.py   Due to the sign convention and range of vector_difference, which is defined in 
                                                                                  geometry.py and was invoked in calc_rel_angles (prior to the fix), computed realtive 
                                                                                  differences were not always internal angles. calc_rel_angles was redifined.  

4.  11 May 2017           11 May 2017             calc_distances,                 Not strictly a bug in that it had no adverse effect on the function of application.   
                                                  calc_abs_angles, and            However, those methods were never used anywhere in the code, so that they were    
                                                  calc_rel_angles in Scene.py     removed.
